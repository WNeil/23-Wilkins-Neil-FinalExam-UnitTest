1.
step 1: write test cases for the implementation in mind
step 2: make an additional if condition to the for loop stating if the parsed number is below zero, throw an exception
step 3: add another additional else to the previous if statement stating if the number is above or equal to 1000, skip that iteration
step 4: test against previously written test cases and adjust code if not passing any.

//negative numbers do 
@Test
public class AddTest1() {
	//im not sure the exact error thrown, assuming IndexOB
	assertThrows(IndexOutOfBounds.class, StringCalculator.add("-1,5"));
}

//digits of bigger than or equal to 1000 are ignored by the function
@Test
public class AddTest2() {
	int test = StringCalculator.add("1, 1000");
	assertEquals(1, test);
}
